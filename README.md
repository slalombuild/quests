# Slalom Quests

This repo contains projects that are used in tandem with Slalom Quests sessions. Slalom Quests is a series of meetup events that will help you level up skills that will help you break into tech. Each session focuses on a different topic; it is not a necessity nor a requirement to attend previous sessions to join a future one.

Each folder inside this repo represents a different session and topic. `cd` into the topic of choice and follow the README for instructions on how to set up that project.
